# e2emapeditorv2.0
## Please note that this mod is not the mod on Moddb.
## also it does currently have no map editing functions 
### i lost the original mod :(

# ALSO NOTE NEVER TRUST ANYONE ON THE INTERNET 
## I wont do anything malicious, like ever, but you need to know that there are people out there who hide viruses in open source Projects, so please never disable antivirus and always check everything on the internet for malicious code
## e.g. in sln files you can add viruses
# Stay Safe!!!

### currently it adds the dev ui and does som other stuff i experimented with,
### also you might check out my try to decompile the game (not yet uploaded) later on.

#### to develop, put the source files into the folder C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\The Escapists 2\e2emapeditorv2.0\e2emapeditor2\
